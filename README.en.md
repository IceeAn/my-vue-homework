# Course Assignment: Web Development Framework

## Project Overview
This project is an assignment for the "Web Development Framework" course. In this project, I will use Vue3 to develop a web frontend. The project includes a simple backend for providing mock data.

## Technology Stack
In addition to Vue 3, which is required by the course, and Bootstrap, with which I am personally familiar, I also plan to learn and apply the following technologies that are new to me in order to expand my knowledge base ~~actually just out of interest~~:
- WASM (developed using Rust)
- SASS
- Spring + Kotlin (for developing the mock backend)

Although Vue3 and Bootstrap are technologies I am familiar with, I will also try to learn and apply new technologies to me such as WASM and SASS.

## Notes
**Please note:** Since this project uses several technologies I am not familiar with, and due to limited development time, there may be errors, design flaws, and non-standard implementations in the project. Therefore, **please be cautious when referring to this project's code**.

## Contributions
If you find any issues in the project, you are welcome to submit an Issue or Pull Request, much appreciated.
